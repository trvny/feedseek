"""GitHub ecosystem feed: GitHub's own blogs plus the app store built on top
of GitHub Releases.

All sources are native RSS:

  * The GitHub Blog and its per-topic channels (changelog, engineering,
    security, open source, AI/ML, enterprise). The channels are subsets of the
    main feed, so the cross-source URL/title dedupe in ``multi_rss`` collapses
    the overlap and the per-topic label survives on whichever copy is kept.
  * GitHub Status incident history.
  * Komi Store, an open-source app store that distributes GitHub Releases.
    Its feed is served from komistore.app but every link points at
    github-store.org, which is the same site under its older domain.

The changelog is the highest-volume channel by far, so it gets the largest
quota. ``max_entries`` is deliberately above the sum of the quotas (290), so a
low-volume source like Komi Store, which posts a few times a year, keeps its
slot instead of being squeezed out by the newest-first trim.
