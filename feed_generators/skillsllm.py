"""SkillsLLM + MCP / Plugins ecosystem feed generator.

Combines AI-tooling sites into a single Atom feed (``feeds/feed_skillsllm.xml``)
using three discovery strategies, each source isolated so one failure never
sinks the run:

Native RSS/Atom feeds (feedparser):
  * Model Context Protocol  https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/index.xml
  * FastMCP (changelog)     https://gofastmcp.com/changelog/rss.xml
  * Agent Client Protocol   https://agentclientprotocol.com/updates/rss.xml
  * Pieces (updates + blog) https://pieces.app/updates/rss.xml, /blog/rss.xml
  * ClaudePluginHub         https://claudepluginhub.com/feed.xml
  * OpenRouter (blog)       https://openrouter.ai/blog/feed.xml
  * LiteLLM (blog)          https://docs.litellm.ai/blog/rss.xml
  * LiteLLM (release notes) https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/releases.atom
                            (docs.litellm.ai/release_notes is a dateless HTML
                            mirror of these GitHub releases)
  * Glama (blog)            https://glama.ai/blog/rss.xml
  * Glama MCP Servers       https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/feeds/recent-servers.xml
                            (recently-registered MCP servers; high-churn, capped)
  * LobeHub (changelog)     https://lobehub.com/pl/changelog/feed
  * LobeHub (blog)          https://lobehub.com/pl/blog/feed
  * AI Skill Market         https://aiskill.market/rss.xml
  * Devin Desktop           https://docs.devin.ai/desktop/changelog/rss.xml
  * Hugging Face Blog       https://huggingface.co/blog/feed.xml
  * MindStudio              https://www.mindstudio.ai/rss.xml

Sitemap discovery + per-page detail fetch (no native feed; pages server-render
real ``<title>`` / ``<meta description>`` and sometimes ``article:published_time``):
  * SkillsLLM           https://skillsllm.com        (/news daily summaries + /blog guides)
  * Desktop Commander   https://desktopcommander.app (/blog posts)
  * Mem0 Blog           https://mem0.ai/blog         (/blog posts; Framer sitemap,
                        no <lastmod>, per-page article:published_time)
  * Mem0 Research       https://mem0.ai/research     (benchmark/research landing page)
  * Claude Skills Hub   https://claudeskills.info    (/blog posts via sitemap_blog.xml)

Index asset-slug discovery + detail fetch (no feed, no sitemap):
  * MCP Servers Blog    https://blog.mcpservers.org  (/posts/<slug>, slugs from
                        /assets/blog/<slug>/ paths on the index)

Dated listing / MDX scrape (no native feed):
  * Cognition             https://cognition.com/blog + /research
  * Devin Release Notes   https://docs.devin.ai/release-notes/overview

Bespoke HTML/MDX scrape (no feed, no sitemap):
  * Glama Release Notes https://glama.ai/release-notes (moved here from the
                        aibridge feed along with the rest of Glama's sources)
  * Mem0 Changelog      https://docs.mem0.ai/changelog/highlights (the raw .md
                        exposes <Update label="DATE"> milestone blocks)


Note: https://mcpservers.org itself is a server *directory* (thousands of
catalog pages, no news stream), so it is intentionally not aggregated here.
Sources evaluated and skipped: claudemarketplaces.com/digest has no feed and
is a near-static 3-issue archive page (not worth a bespoke scraper);
llmbase.ai/news/ sits behind a Cloudflare bot challenge (403 on every fetch
strategy tried) and can't be scraped at all; anysearch.com/blog has no feed,
no <link rel="alternate"> autodiscovery, and every common feed path
(/feed, /rss.xml, /atom.xml, /feed.xml, /blog/feed, /blog/rss.xml) 404s —
zero signal to build a scraper from.

Dates, per source:
  * SkillsLLM news      — from the ``/news/ai-news-YYYY-MM-DD`` slug
  * SkillsLLM blog      — from the sitemap ``<lastmod>``
  * Claude Skills Hub   — from the sitemap ``<lastmod>`` (or page ``published_time``)
  * Desktop Commander   — from the page's ``article:published_time`` meta
  * Native feeds        — from the feed entry's published/updated date
  * MCP Servers Blog    — no date exposed; stable per-link fallback

Entries merge into a local cache, dedup by ``link`` and then by normalized
URL/title, and are trimmed with a per-source quota.
