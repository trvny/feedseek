"""Probe every source docs/sources.md lists and report the ones that are gone.

The document is derived from the generators now, so it is always an accurate
list of what they *intend* to read. It says nothing about whether those URLs
still answer - and a source that started 404ing does not fail anything: the
generator logs a warning nobody reads, the feed keeps publishing from its other
sources, and the dead one just quietly stops contributing. Combined feeds hide
this best, which is exactly where most sources live.

    python tools/check_sources.py                 # every source, grouped by feed
    python tools/check_sources.py --broken        # only what needs fixing
    python tools/check_sources.py --feed lemmy    # one feed

Exits 1 when something is broken, so it works as a manual gate.

Deliberately not part of validate_feeds.py: it needs the network and talks to
507+ third-party hosts, so wiring it into the scheduled run would let someone
else's outage fail a build that produced perfectly good feeds.
